abstract: "Response inhibition is key to flexible behavior. Importantly, performance in any task, including response
inhibition tasks, fluctuates on a moment-to-moment basis. Using pupillometry, we investigated the rela-
tionship between these behavioral fluctuations in response inhibition and naturally-occurring fluctuations
of norepinephrine (NE) levels in the brain before a given trial has even started. This was motivated by
earlier pharmacological work suggesting a pivotal role of NE in response inhibition, in particular. We
specifically used two pupillometry proxies for pretrial (tonic) NE levels, the absolute pretrial pupil size
and its derivative, and investigated whether and to which degree they were related to response-inhibition
performance in a stop-signal task. Specifically, we investigated the relationship to stopping success,
and the speed of the go response (GoRT) and that of the stop response (SSRT). In two experiments,
we showed that larger pretrial pupil measures predicted (1) lower stopping success, (2) faster GoRTs
(particularly so when the go response needed to be executed in a stop context), and some evidence for
(3) faster SSRTs. Taken together, our findings show a clear pattern that pretrial pupil measures predict
behavioral fluctuations in response inhibition, which suggests that tonic levels of NE are involved in the
regulation of these behavioral fluctuations. Yet, our work furthermore indicates that this involvement is
not stopping-specific, given its effect on both the go and the stop response."
