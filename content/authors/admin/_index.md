Dear visitor

My name is Quinn Cabooter and I am currently a student in experimental psychology at Ghent University. I am scheduled to graduate in August 2022 and I am currently looking for PhD opportunities to continue my career in academics. You are welcome to take a look through my portfolio. Keep in mind, however, that this website is still a work in progress.
