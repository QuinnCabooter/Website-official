Dear visitor

My name is Quinn Cabooter and I am currently a research assisant at Ghent University. I graduated as Master in Theoretical and Experimental Psychology in August 2022. Recently, I submitted a PhD grant proposal. Awaiting the results, I am performing research experiments for the lab of Prof. Nico Boehler, I am writing a review article and I am in the process of submitting the results of my Master thesis for publication. Results, findings and publications from my research will be communicated via this platform. Feel free to browse around!
