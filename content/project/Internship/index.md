Abstract: 
The many benefits of online research and the recent emergence of open-source eyetracking libraries have sparked the interest in transferring time-consuming and expensive eyetracking studies from lab to web. In the current study, we validate online webcam-based eyetracking by replicating three robust eye-tracking studies (the cascade effect, n = 134, the novelty
preference, n = 45, and the visual world paradigm, n = 32) online using the participant's webcam
as eye-tracker with the WebGazer.js library. We successfully replicated all three effects,
although the effect sizes of all three studies shrank by 20 to 27%. The visual world paradigm
was not only conducted online but also in the lab, using the same participants and a standard
laboratory eye-tracker. This showed that replication per se could not fully account for the effect
size shrinkage, but that the shrinkage is also due to the use of online webcam-based eyetracking, which is noisier. In conclusion, we argue that eye-tracking studies with relatively large
effects that do not require extremely high precision (e.g., studies with 4 or fewer large regions
of interest) can be done online using the participantâ€™s webcam. We also make recommendations
for how the quality of online webcam-based eye-tracking could be improved.
